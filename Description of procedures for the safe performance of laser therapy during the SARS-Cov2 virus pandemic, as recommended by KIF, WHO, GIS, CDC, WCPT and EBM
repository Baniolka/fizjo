# Description of procedures for the safe performance of laser therapy during the SARS-Cov2 virus pandemic, as recommended by KIF, WHO, GIS, CDC, WCPT and EBM. <!-- omit in toc --> 



## Physiotherapist Protection Procedure:

### Stage 1 - Starting work.

The recommendations instruct.

1.1 Before starting work, the physiotherapist should protect themselves by:
- a long-sleeved waterproof apron,
- safety goggles or a protective visor,
- medical disposable gloves. 
  - Class of protection: diagnostic examinations, surgical procedures, contact with irritant substances. 
  - Type of material: latex, nitrile, vinyl.
- Protective mask fitted tightly from the root of the nose to the chin. 

1.2. Physiotherapist's obligations:
- hand disinfection (according to standards or according to GIS recommendations for surgical washing),
- avoiding grouping of patients (especially during kinesitherapy or physiotherapy),
- using an individual approach with the physiotherapist. 

1.3. Organisation of the physiotherapist's work:
- avoid unnecessary transfers between departments,
- one physiotherapist-one workplace ( department, subdepartment),
- Systematic disinfection with alcohol-based products: mobile phones, pens, bed remotes and TV sets. 

**IMPORTANT!**
It is forbidden to reuse the same agents on the next patient (e.g. wet electrotherapy pads)!

1.4. After finishing work (according to WHO):
- remove personal protective equipment,
- perform hygienic hand disinfection
- dispose of personal protective equipment in the red bag.


### Stage 2 - Risk assessment, interview

In the next stage of the work, the physiotherapist is required to make a risk assessment based on knowledge provided from certain sources such as:
 
- Communications of the Chief Sanitary Inspector
- Communications from the Ministry of Health
- The National Chamber of Physiotherapists
- Communications from the National Health Fund
- Communications from the World Health Organisation (WHO)
 
If you observe symptoms of COVID-19 disease in yourself or a patient, stop work and, limiting direct contact, inform the relevant services (does not apply to infectious wards).
The epidemiological interview should be carried out first, before any activities are undertaken, including the completion of the pre-qualification questionnaire (appendix 1 - Pre-qualification questionnaire) and the patient's consent to perform physiotherapy activities.
 
If the clinical condition allows, the patient should be equipped with a protective mask for the time of contact with the physiotherapist /personnel/.

#chapter 1

Stage 3 - Physiotherapy examination
 
# chapter 3

The physiotherapist is obliged to carry out the physiotherapy examination with particular attention to the epidemiological interview, and the information from this interview absolutely must be recorded in the medical records created by the physiotherapist. Each day, before providing health services, the physiotherapist shall conduct an epidemiological interview with the patient or ward staff according to Appendix 2 (appendix 2 - Update questionnaire).

While performing all activities with a patient, a physiotherapist shall use maximally safe, obtainable personal protective equipment (according to GIS, and WHO recommendations) ensuring safety for both the physiotherapist and the patient.
If such protection is not available, the physiotherapist shall refrain from the activity and the fact shall be recorded in the medical documentation. /ECDC recommendations on donning and doffing PPE when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).

Step 4 - Laser therapy treatment

# Chapter 3
 
The rooms in which physiotherapy inpatient treatment takes place should be disinfected and ventilated each time the patient's work is completed. Instruments and equipment used during physiotherapy should be disinfected after work.
In the case of exposure to infectious material for the exposed person, the actions should be carried out according to the instructions /separate facility procedure or, if the facility does not have elaborations, according to GIS guidelines/.
Standard precautions such as removal from the treatment area and surrounding area, reflective objects, and putting on protective goggles should be taken before starting the procedure. The skin should be dry, without ointments or medications. We inform the patient about contraindications, if the patient does not have contraindications we select the method of performing the laser therapy treatment according to the need. We position the laser at a suitable distance. We then set the device parameters and time.
The preparation procedure for a laser therapy treatment during a pandemic should start with the preparation of appropriate personal protective equipment, i.e. aprons or protective suits, masks, visors, disposable gloves, shoes and hair protectors (if the suit does not provide this).
Then gather disinfectants for decontamination of the room, surgery equipment and disinfection of hands and clothing with proven virucidal effect
For example
- for hygienic and surgical hand and skin disinfection: Manusan, Hospisept, Spitaderm, Sagrosept 
- for surface disinfection: Chloramine 5%, Javel-in 1%, Medicarine 0.36%, Oxapol 2%, Virkon 2%.

When carrying out laser therapy, the room is occupied by one patient and one physiotherapist. The appropriately protected physiotherapist: suit or disposable apron, gloves, mask and visor, patient: mask + gloves.
Before entering, the patient disinfects their gloves and enters the room, staying there only for the duration of the treatment, approx. 6-12 minutes (selected individually). He then leaves the room.
When carrying out the treatment, the physiotherapist should be particularly careful, i.e. connect the treatment apparatus in the shortest possible time and then disinfect their hands with the disinfectant.

Step 5- Disinfection

#chapter 3

After the procedure, the physiotherapist disinfects the apparatus used in the procedure, the place where the patient was sitting or lying, the door handles and the floor and surfaces the patient may have come into contact with to protect themselves and the patient. If there is a window in the room it is recommended to ventilate the treatment room.
The physiotherapist should put away any disinfectants in a designated place. Dispose of the disposable disinfecting materials in a special bin with a red medical waste bag. The physiotherapist must remove the disposable gloves and mask and then place them in the medical waste bin. For safety reasons, in the next step, we wash our hands thoroughly followed by a hand disinfectant.
Before the next patient, we follow the procedure of applying another pair of gloves and a new face mask.
By following these recommendations developed by the special organisation referred to in the title of the task, we maintain our safety and that of our surroundings at the time and place of our work.
In our opinion, the greatest risk of contagion from the patient is when he or she arrives at the surgery, which is why the physiotherapist informs the patient of the proper precautions to be taken and the distance of about 1.5 metres. Then, depending on the treatment, the patient gets into position and the physiotherapist also carries out the treatment at the furthest possible distance.
