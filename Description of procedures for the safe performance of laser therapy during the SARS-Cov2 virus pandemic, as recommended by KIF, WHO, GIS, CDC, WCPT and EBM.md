# Description of procedures for the safe performance of laser therapy during the SARS-Cov2 virus pandemic, as recommended by KIF, WHO, GIS, CDC, WCPT and EBM. <!-- omit in toc --> 


## Physiotherapist Protection Procedure:

### Stage 1 - Starting work.

The recommendations instruct.

**1.1 Before starting work, the physiotherapist should protect themselves by:**
- a long-sleeved waterproof apron,
- safety goggles or a protective visor,
- medical disposable gloves. 
  - Class of protection: diagnostic examinations, surgical procedures, contact with irritant substances. 
  - Type of material: latex, nitrile, vinyl.
- Protective mask fitted tightly from the root of the nose to the chin. 

**1.2. Physiotherapist's obligations:**
- hand disinfection (according to standards or according to GIS recommendations for surgical washing),
- avoiding grouping of patients (especially during kinesitherapy or physiotherapy),
- using an individual approach with the physiotherapist. 

**1.3. Organisation of the physiotherapist's work:**
- avoid unnecessary transfers between departments,
- one physiotherapist-one workplace ( department, subdepartment),
- Systematic disinfection with alcohol-based products: mobile phones, pens, bed remotes and TV sets. 

>**IMPORTANT!**
>It is forbidden to reuse the same agents on the next patient (e.g. wet electrotherapy pads)!

**1.4. After finishing work (according to WHO):**
- remove personal protective equipment,
- perform hygienic hand disinfection,
- dispose of personal protective equipment in the red bag.



### Stage 2 - Risk assessment, interview

**2.1 Next stage: the physiotherapist is required to make a risk assessment based on knowledge provided from certain sources such as:**
- Communications of the Chief Sanitary Inspector,
- Communications from the Ministry of Health,
- The National Chamber of Physiotherapists,
- Communications from the National Health Fund,
- Communications from the World Health Organisation (WHO).
 
**2.2 If the physiotherapist has noticed symptoms of illness in themselves or the patient, they should:**
- interrupt their work,
- limiting direct contact, informing the relevant services of the symptoms (does not apply to infectious disease departments).

>**IMPORTANT!** 
>- First, conduct an epidemiological interview.
>- Perform further activities, including completing the initial qualification questionnaire (Appendix No. 1 - Initial qualification questionnaire) and signing the patient's consent to perform physiotherapy activities.

*If the clinical condition allows it, the patient must wear a protective mask for the duration of contact with the physiotherapist /personnel.*



### Stage 3 - Physiotherapy examination

- The physiotherapist is obliged to carry out the physiotherapy examination with particular attention to the epidemiological interview. 
- The information from this interview absolutely must be recorded in the medical records created by the physiotherapist. 
- Each day, before providing health services, the physiotherapist shall conduct an epidemiological interview with the patient or ward staff according to Appendix 2 (appendix 2 - Update questionnaire).

**3.1 The physiotherapist's responsibility during all activities with the patient** * to use the maximum safe, obtainable personal protective equipment (as recommended by GIS, WHO) ensuring the safety of both the physiotherapist and the patient.

**3.2 In the absence of such protection:** *
- abandon the activity,
- note this fact in the medical records. 

*ECDC recommendations on donning and doffing PPE when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).*



### Stage 4 - Laser therapy treatment

**4.1 Each time after working with a patient, physiotherapist should:**
- disinfect and ventilate the rooms where physiotherapy inpatient treatment takes place;
- disinfect tools and equipment used during treatment. 

**In the case of exposure to infectious material for the exposed person**, the actions should be carried out according to the instructions: 
- separate facility procedure,
- if the facility does not have elaborations, according to GIS guidelines. 

**4.2 Before starting the treatment (standard procerure):**
- take standard precautions:
  - remove from the treatment area and surrounding area, reflective objects; 
  - wear protective goggles; 
- the skin should be dry, without ointment or medication; 
- inform the patient of contraindications; 
- if the patient does not have contraindications select the method of laser;
- therapy according to the needs; 
- position the laser at a suitable distance;
- set the device parameters and time.

**4.2.1 Additional guidance during the pandemic:**
- prepare appropriate personal protective equipment, i.e. aprons/protective suits, masks, face visors, disposable gloves, shoes and hair protectors (if missing from suit);
- collect disinfectants for disinfecting rooms, and equipment in the surgery;
- collect disinfectants for disinfecting hands and clothing (with proven virucidal effect).
    
>For example:
>- for hygienic and surgical hand and skin disinfection: Manusan, Hospisept, Spitaderm, Sagrosept 
>- for surface disinfection: Chloramine 5%, Javel-in 1%, Medicarine 0.36%, Oxapol 2%, Virkon 2%.

**4.3 When performing a laser therapy treatment (procedure):**
- physiotherapist's protection: suit or disposable apron, gloves, mask and face visor;
- patient protection: mask + gloves.
- there is only 1 patient and 1 physiotherapist in the room;
- patient disinfects his gloves before entering the room;
- patient stay = only for the duration of the treatment (6-12 minutes, selected individually) then leaves.
- physiotherapist after the treatment with caution:
  - connects the treatment device as soon as possible,
  - disinfects hands with disinfectant. 



### Stage 5- Disinfection

**5.1 After performing the treatment, the physiotherapist should:** 
- disinfect:
  - the treatment device,
  - the place where the patient was sitting/lying,
  - the door handles.
- Wash the floor and surfaces which the patient may have come into contact with.
- Ventilate the treatment room (if there is a window).
- Put back in the designated area any disinfectants.
- Put disposable disinfecting materials into the red bag (medical supplies). 
- Take off and put in the red bag (medical supplies) disposable gloves and mask.
- Wash hands thoroughly and disinfect with liquid.
- Before the next patient, wear a new mask and a pair of gloves according to the procedure.

The greatest risk of contagion from the patient is when he or she arrives at the surgery, which is why the physiotherapist:
- informs the patient of the proper precautions to be taken;
- the distance of about 1.5 metres. 

Then, depending on the treatment, the patient gets into position and the physiotherapist also carries out the treatment at the furthest possible distance.


### By following these recommendations developed by the special organisation referred to in the title of the task, we maintain our safety and that of our surroundings at the time and place of our work. ###
